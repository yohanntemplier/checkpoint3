                    The most famous pirate of the world, the great and inimitable Captain Jack Sparrow, is looking for
                    the lost treasure of Rackham the Red, an old and pitiless pirate who spread terror among the Caribbean seas,
                    long long time ago.
                </p>
                <p>An old sailor from France Kingdom, the Captain Haddock, has given Jack a mysterious map, with many islands on it.
                    Haddock only knew that the treasure is burried on one of these islands.
                    Jack and his crew have the mission to navigate to each of them, until they find the golden pieces
                    and precious stones which constitute the hidden treasure.</p>

                        Hello ship's boy, <strong>read carefully all the instructions</strong> below before starting to code ;)
                        <br/>
                        Each step is relatively independent, do not hesitate to move on to the next if you stay blocked
                        too long on one step.
                        Also, remember you can request assistance to your former ;)
                        <br/>
                        You have to push your code on this project repository, with your city, firstname and
                        lastname as a branch name (e.g. TORTUGA_JACK_SPARROW). Furthermore, think about atomic commits!

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Look at the navbar, there is a <a href="{{ path('map') }}">Map</a> link (/map url). The
                        Black Pearl can navigate on this map, which is build with Tiles (Tile entity). Each
                        Tile has coordinates (x, y) and a type (sea, port, island). The Black Pearl (one Boat entity) also has
                        coordinates, so he can be displayed on a chosen tile of the map.

                        <p>Right now, the database is empty (no boat and no tile): Jack is still in the firm ground! <br/>
                            First of all, you have to fill the database. Fortunately, we have fixtures ready ! Lauch
                            <code>php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load</code>.
                            Answer <code>y</code> at the question and that's it, you have data.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        On the map, you can move the boat with the moveBoatAction() method of the BoatController (it already exist).
                        As you can see in the code, you just have to use the route <em>/boat/move/x/y</em> (x and y should be coordinates)
                        and the Black Pearl will go on the right tile.
                        Then, this method redirect the browser directly on the map.

                    <li>
                        <em>moveBoat()</em> method is cool, however, it is more like a teleport than a real move...<br/>
                        In BoatController, create a moveDirection() method which take a <em>direction</em> as parameter.
                        This direction can only be one of these four strings : 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W'. For example, <em>/boat/move/A</em> must not work (Symfony will generate a 404 error).
                        Of course, the method should move the boat in the right direction.
                        After the move, redirect the browser on <em>/map</em>.
                        <br/>
                        <span class="hint">Hint: </span> Add four links on the map view to allow the user to move on the 4 possible ways.
                        Put your buttons on the div class "navigation" (it already exists).<br/>
                        <span class="hint">Hint2: </span>If you do not succeed to implement moveDirection(), go ahead and use the already existing moveBoat() method for the following steps instead of moveDirection().
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Right now, if you move your boat on a nonexistent tile, the boat just disappear on there is no error message.
                        To prevent Jack to getting lost, you will have to prevent moving outside the map.
                        Create a *MapManager* service, in the /src/App/Services folder, and create a tileExists() method
                        (it takes coordinates x and y as argument, and return a boolean). It should test if the tile with these coordinates exists or not.
                        <br/>
                        <span class="hint">Hint: </span>Use TileRepository in your service.
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        Use this new service and this new method in the moveDirection() method, to display an error (and prevent the boat to move)
                        if the destination tile does not exist.
                        <br/>
                        <span class="hint">Hint: </span>Use flash messages for the error message. The display of flash message is already implemented in base.html.twig.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In the map/index.html.twig file, in the <code>div</code> with the class "infos", add the following information about the boat :
                        <ul>
                            <li>its coordinates (x, y)</li>
                            <li>type of the tile where the boat actually is</li>
                        </ul>
                        <span class="hint">Hint: </span>of course, do not hesitate to edit the code of displayMapAction() on MapController.
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        Add the property <code>$hasTreasure</code> (a boolean) on Tile entity. It will allow to know if the treasure is on a tile or not.
                        Don't forget to create getter / setter and to update your database.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In MapManager, create a getRandomIsland() method. It should return a <strong>random</strong> Tile with <strong>island</strong> type.
                        To do that, you should first get all island tiles in an array, then return one tile randomly (in php).
                        <br/>
                        <span class="hint">Hint: </span>Look at <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/fr/function.array-rand.php">array_rand()</a> function.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In MapController, create a startAction() method (with a <em>/start</em> route) which launch a new game.
                        The method must reset boat coordinates to 0,0. It also must put the treasure on a random island.
                        Finally, it will redirect on <em>/map</em>.
                        <br/>
                        <span class="hint">Hint: </span>Warning, only one treasure can be on the map, don't forget to remove it
                        from the map <strong>before</strong> put one in another tile ;)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        On MapManager, create checkTreasure() method. The method take a Boat objet as parameter, and should check that this boat is on the tile with the treasure and return true or false.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        This method must be called <strong>after each move</strong> of the boat. If it return true, a flash success message must be displayed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
